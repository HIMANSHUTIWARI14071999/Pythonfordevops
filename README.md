# Pythonfordevops
This project demonstrates how to automate the creation and management of AWS S3 buckets and objects using Python wrappers around the AWS SDK (Boto3). The wrapper functions simplify common S3 operations like creating buckets, uploading files, and managing objects, making it easier to integrate cloud storage tasks into automation workflows.
